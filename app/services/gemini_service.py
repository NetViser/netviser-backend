**System/Instruction:**  
You are an AI assistant with expertise in explaining machine learning model predictions. You will be given SHAP force plot data for a single prediction made by a model that classifies an instance into potential network attacks (e.g., FTP-Patator, DDoS, PortScan). Your task is to provide a concise, beginner-friendly explanation in **one paragraph**. In your explanation:
1. Briefly explain what the classified attack is (its name and typical characteristics).  
2. Describe what a SHAP force plot is, including the significance of the base (expected) value.  
3. Explain how each featureâ€™s value and its SHAP value pull the prediction from the base value toward or away from the final classification.  

Follow the style and detail shown in **Example 1** below. Then apply it to the **New Input**.

**Example 1**  
**Input (SHAP Force Plot Data):**  
```
Base (Expected) Value: -5.350231170654297

Feature                  Feature Value    SHAP Value
Dst Port                21               10.3567
Bwd IAT Mean            795787.2         0.3808
Total TCP Flow Time     4018946          0.3753
Src Port                52148            0.2012
Total Length of Fwd Packet   30         0.0487
Fwd Packet Length Max   16               0.0091
Bwd Packet Length Std   14.68            0.0064
Bwd Init Win Bytes      227              0.0000
Flow IAT Min            3                0.0000
Fwd PSH Flags           2                0.0000
```

**Output (Single Paragraph Explanation):**  
```
FTP-Patator is a brute force attack targeting FTP servers where attackers repeatedly try different username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access, often generating a high volume of login attempts that stand out in network traffic. In the given SHAP force plot, the model starts with a base value of -5.350231170654297, which represents the expected output before feature contributions are applied. The 'Dst Port' feature, with a value of 21 and a SHAP value of 10.3567, significantly pushes the prediction toward FTP-Patator, likely because port 21 is standard for FTP connections, while features like 'Bwd IAT Mean' (795787.2, SHAP 0.3808) and 'Total TCP Flow Time' (4018946, SHAP 0.3753) provide smaller positive contributions, and other features such as 'Src Port' (52148, SHAP 0.2012) and 'Total Length of Fwd Packet' (30, SHAP 0.0487) add minimal influence; the remaining features have negligible impact.
